# Mini-Lab: Logistic Regression and SVM's

You are to perform predictive analysis (classification) upon a data set: model the dataset using
methods we have discussed in class: logistic regression and support vector machines, and making conclusions from the analysis. Follow the CRISP-DM framework in your analysis
(you are not performing all of the CRISP-DM outline, only the portions 
relevant to the grading rubric outlined below). 
This report is worth 10% of the final grade. You may complete this assignment in teams of as many as three people.  

Write a report covering all the steps of the project. The format of the document can be PDF,
*.ipynb, or HTML. You can write the report in whatever format you like, but it is easiest to turn in the
rendered iPython notebook. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully
describe every assumption and every step in your report.
